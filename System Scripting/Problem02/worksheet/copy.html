	<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

	<p>The Support Team where you belong has a website that’s maintained by your team to put useful information and support related issues. It’s been defaced. And this is not the first time! </p>

	<p>The website would normally look like this. </p>

	<p><img alt="" src="media/goodsite.png" style="width:600px;margin-left:40px;"/></p>

	<p>But after the website is defaced, it looked like:</p>

	<p><img alt="" src="media/owned.png" style="width:600px;margin-left:40px;"/></p>

	<p>The Support Team web pages are all in static <span class="caps">HTML</span> generated using tool similar to C307 Problem 2. </p>

	<p>Write a Python code to automatically check and replace any web pages that have been defaced to their original files for every 1 minute.</p>

	<p>You can start working given this problem statement. But if you’re wondering how the problem cropped up in the first place you can read further on <span onclick="shownote();" style="color:blue;cursor:pointer;">background</span> here.</p>

<div id="note" style="display: none;">

	<h2>The Background</h2>

	<p>The Support Team web pages are all static <span class="caps">HTML</span> generated automatically using similar tool in Problem 2. But it’s hosted together with the corporate website which some custom web applications written in <span class="caps">PHP</span>. After security investigation, your team found out that the Support Team website was hacked through some simple exploits found in the custom web applications. One of the member in your team contacted the developer of that particular web application, but she’s either ignored or told that the problem was with the Support Team itself.</p>

	<p>Escalating the issue to your manager, and that’s when your team found out about the complexity of the problem here. The developer who’s working on that particular web application is new. He’s been working for about 3 months, a hot shot scholar who’s recently graduated from some prestigous US university with an ego as big as two data centers, and an attitude to match. He’s the company’s a poster boy because the <span class="caps">CEO</span> has touted several times on how successful the company is in attracting brilliant talent like him. The last nail in the coffin is that this developer is also the brother-in-law of your manager.</p>

	<p>After careful audit of his code, your team found out that he’s not so brilliant nor talented after all. There are many basic programming security practices that he broke, and the code was poorly written also. So, the hype about him is really overblown. Yet, your team has no one that can match his education background, which in the end makes it really hard to convince upper management about the root cause of this issue. Your manager has kept his silent throughout for being afraid that he might offend his brother-in-law. </p>

	<p>In the end, even with the mounting evidence that the security problem is caused by this particular developer, yet no action is taken to support your team to fix the issue. Your team still gets the blame of every defacement incident on the support website.</p>

	<p>Your team, therefore, has decided to rely on one thing they can trust – their own technical skills. It’s decided that it’s best to write a code that can detect when any of the support web pages get defaced, the defaced web pages can be quickly and automatically replaced by the original web pages. The plan is to automatically run this program every one minute.</p>
