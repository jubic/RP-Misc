== Problem 1 ==
Given a text "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", create a string that can be assigned to a Powerpoint shape to form bulleted entries like

 * One
 * Two
 * Three
 * Four

Note: you may assume the following "p" object is created, and it's using Shapes(2).
p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).  # note this is not a complete code

Answer:
-------
p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "One\r\nTwo\r\nThree\r\nFour\r\n"

== Problem 2 ==
Given a list ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"], create a string that can be assigned to a Powerpoint shape to form bulleted entries like

 * One
 * Two
 * Three
 * Four

Note: you may assume the following "p" object is created, and it's using Shapes(2).
p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).  # note this is not a complete code

Answer:
-------
str = ""
d = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"]
for s in d:
	str += s + "\r\n"

p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = str

== Problem 3 ==
Given the following code:
d = []
d.append("One")
d.append("Two")
d.append("Three")
d.append("Four")

Write a code to make the content of "d" list to have a string that can be assigned to a Powerpoint shape to form bulleted entries like:

 * One
 * Two
 * Three
 * Four

Note: you may assume the following "p" object is created, and it's using Shapes(2).
p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).  # note this is not a complete code

Answer:
-------
str = ""
d = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"]
for s in d:
	str += s + "\r\n"

p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = str

== Problem 4 ==
Given a text "One", "Two", "Sub Two", "Three" create a string that can be assigned to a Powerpoint shape to form bulleted entries like

 * One
 * Two
    * Sub Two
 * Three

Complete the following code:

p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2)...

Answer:
-------
p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "One\r\nTwo\r\nThree\r\nFour"
p.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text.Paragraphs(3).Indentlevel = 2

== Problem 5 ==
Given a list ["One", "Two", "Sub Two", "Three"], create a string that can be assigned to a Powerpoint shape to form bulleted entries like

 * One
 * Two
   * Sub Two
 * Three

Note: you may assume the following "p" object is created, and it's using Shapes(2).
p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).  # note this is not a complete code

Answer:
-------
str = ""
d = ["One", "Two", "Sub Two", "Three"]
for s in d:
	str += s + "\r\n"

p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = str
p.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text.Paragraphs(3).Indentlevel = 2

== Problem 6 ==
Given the following code:
d = []
d.append("One")
d.append("Two")
d.append("Sub Two")
d.append("Three")

Write a code to make the content of "d" list to have a string that can be assigned to a Powerpoint shape to form bulleted entries like:

 * One
 * Two
   * Sub Two
 * Three

Note: you may assume the following "p" object is created, and it's using Shapes(2).
p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).  # note this is not a complete code

Answer:
-------
str = ""
d = ["One", "Two", "Sub Two", "Three"]
for s in d:
	str += s + "\r\n"

p = Presentation.Slides.Add(2, constants.ppLayoutText)
p.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = str
p.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text.Paragraphs(3).Indentlevel = 2
