title: Core Web Servers down

problem: Web servers became inaccessible after configuration changes

p1: The web server went down due to misconfiguration in the Apache config. Some supporting libraries were also missing in the Linux machines that host the web server.

solution: Reinstall Linux and reconfigure Apache

p2: The integrator was inexperience with Linux, and the deployment of Apcahe config was done without proper checking and testing. It took about 1 hour to pinpoint the config error, and the web servers were inaccesible during that period.
